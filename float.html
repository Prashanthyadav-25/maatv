A Sikh temple is called a Gurdwara, literally the doorway to the Guru. Its most essential element is the presence of the Guru, Guru Granth Sahib. The Gurdwara has an entrance from all sides, signifying that they are open to all without any distinction whatsoever. The Gurdwara has a Darbar Sahib where the Guru Granth Sahib is seen and a Langar where people can eat free food.[11] A Gurdwara may also have a library, nursery, and classroom.[12] A Gurdwara can be identified from a distance by tall flagpoles bearing the Nishan Sahib, the Sikh flag..</p>
